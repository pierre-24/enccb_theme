# Drupal theme `enccb_theme`

Theme for the [EuroCC NCC Belgium website](https://www.enccb.be/). Currently in development.

## Development

On your computer,

1. Create a [minimal drupal install](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-develop-a-drupal-9-website-on-your-local-machine-using-docker-and-ddev).
2. Clone the repository in `/web/theme`.
3. Go in `Admin > Appearance` and "Install and set as default" the "ENCCB theme".
4. Any time you change something and want to check the result, go in `Admin > Configuration > Development > Performances` and "clear all caches". 

... Have fun!
